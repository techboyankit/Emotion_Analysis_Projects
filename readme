Hello Reader !

* Here I have shown two Deep Learning projects which contain the
  model of detecting and analyzing human emotions and sentiments from
  given texts using NPL Algorithm.
  
* Regarding text.ipynb file,I have implemented the folowing :-
  - Modules/Libraries : re,Counter,train_test_split,
                        accuracy_score,SVC,LinearSVC,
                        RandomForestClassifier,
                        DecisionTreeClassifier
  
  - Dataset named 'text' is provided.
  
  - I have defined functions namely : ngram,create_feature  
                                      and convert_label
  - I have done feature extraction using tfid Vectorizer and
    sklearn.
    
  - Lastly, the emotions are depicted in the form of emojis too.
