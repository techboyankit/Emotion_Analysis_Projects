Hello Reader !

* Here I have shown two Deep Learning projects which contain the
  model of detecting and analyzing human emotions and sentiments from
  given texts using NPL Algorithm.
  
* Regarding text.ipynb file,I have implemented the folowing :-
  - Modules/Libraries : re,Counter,train_test_split,
                        accuracy_score,SVC,LinearSVC,
                        RandomForestClassifier,
                        DecisionTreeClassifier
  
  - Dataset named 'text' is provided.
  
  - I have defined functions namely : ngram,create_feature  
                                      and convert_label
  - I have done feature extraction using TFIDF Vectorizer and
    sklearn.
    
  - Lastly, the emotions are depicted in the form of emojis too. 


* Regarding tweet_emotions file, I have implemented the following ideas :-
  - NLTK library.
  
  - Sklearn library for feature extraction and encoding-decoding
    output labels with the help of Label Encoder,TFIDF Vectorizer
    and Count Vectorizer.
  
  - Concept of stop words,Lemmatization and Tokenization.
  
  - Random Forest Classsifier for logistic and linear regression.
  
  - Vader Sentiment.
  
  
* Both the specified projects have been done in Jupyter Notebook tool
  in Python language.
